# apps.yaml (QA)
# Purpose: List apps that should be provisioned for THIS environment directory.
# How itâ€™s used: locals.tf reads .apps[*].app_name and .key_group_name, and
#   derives app_key internally as "<app_name>-<env_filter>".
# Add an app: copy one of your dev/prod entries here and change key_group_name if needed.
# Keep this empty list if QA has no apps yet.
