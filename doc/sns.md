To handle bounce and complaint notifications in Amazon SES using SNS, you need to configure your SES identities to send these notifications to an SNS topic, which can then be processed by an SQS queue or a Lambda function. This allows you to track bounces and complaints, update your email lists, and maintain a healthy sender reputation. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Here's a breakdown of the process: 
1. Configure SES to Send Notifications: 

• Verify Identities: Ensure your sending email addresses or domains are verified in SES. [5, 6]  
• Create SNS Topic: Create an SNS topic to receive bounce and complaint notifications. [2, 6]  
• Enable Feedback Notifications: In your verified identity's settings, enable feedback notifications for bounces and complaints, and select the SNS topic you created. [6, 7]  
• Consider Configuration Sets: For more granular control, use configuration sets to manage different notification settings for different identities or environments. [4, 8]  

2. Process Notifications: 

• SQS Queue (Optional but Recommended): Subscribe an SQS queue to the SNS topic. This allows you to process notifications asynchronously and at your own pace, preventing SES from throttling your processing. [2, 2, 3, 3, 9, 10]  
• Lambda Function: Create a Lambda function that subscribes to the SNS topic (or the SQS queue if you are using one). This function will be triggered when a bounce or complaint notification is published. [3, 3, 11, 11]  
• Lambda Function Logic: 
	• Parse Notifications: The Lambda function needs to parse the notification payload to extract relevant information, such as the bounce type (permanent or transient), the email address, and the reason for the bounce. [11, 11, 12, 13]  
	• Update Lists: Based on the notification type, you can update your email lists, remove invalid addresses, or flag them for further review. [11, 11, 14, 14, 15, 16]  
	• Handle Different Bounce Types: Different bounce types (e.g., "Undetermined", "Permanent", "Transient") require different handling. For example, "Permanent" bounces (hard bounces) should likely result in immediate removal from your list, while "Transient" bounces (soft bounces) might be retried. [11, 11]  
	• Handle Complaints: Complaints (when a recipient marks your email as spam) should also be handled by removing the email address from your list and potentially adding it to a suppression list. [11, 11, 14, 14, 17, 18]  

• Testing: Thoroughly test your setup to ensure notifications are being delivered correctly and your Lambda function is processing them as expected. [3, 3, 11, 11]  

3. Best Practices: 

• Monitor Bounce Rates: Keep a close watch on your bounce and complaint rates. According to AWS documentation, if the bounce rate for your account exceeds 10%, SES might temporarily pause your account's ability to send email. [19, 19, 20, 20]  
• Maintain List Hygiene: Regularly clean your email lists by removing bounced addresses and unsubscribed users. [14, 14, 20, 20]  
• Consider Third-Party Verification Services: Services like ZeroBounce can help you verify email addresses before sending, reducing the chances of bounces. [4, 4, 21]  
• Use Different Configuration Sets for Different Environments: If you have different environments (e.g., development, staging, production), use separate configuration sets with different notification settings. [4, 4]
