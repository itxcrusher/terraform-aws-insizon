The file extension .tftpl indicates a Terraform template file. These files are used to define configuration templates that are then rendered by Terraform into actual configuration files for infrastructure resources. Terraform uses these templates to generate dynamic, configuration-based files. [1, 2]  
Elaboration: 

• Purpose: Terraform template files, with or without the .tftpl extension, are used to store templates that can be dynamically rendered to create configuration files for various infrastructure resources, like virtual machines, networks, and databases. [1, 1, 2, 2]  
• Syntax: These files utilize Terraform's string literals and interpolation syntax to allow for dynamic variable substitution during the rendering process, ensuring that each instance receives the correct configuration based on the Terraform state. [1, 1, 2, 2]  
• Benefits: Using .tftpl or a similar custom extension helps in project readability and organization, clearly identifying Terraform template files. This approach allows for the creation of a single, reusable template file instead of maintaining numerous, hardcoded files for different servers. [1, 1, 3, 3]  
• Example: A user-data.tftpl file might contain a shell script with placeholders for database credentials, backend addresses, firewall rules, and authentication settings. Terraform then renders this template to generate the correct configuration file for each instance, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of errors. [1, 1, 4]
